## Testing
---
- Tested on browsers: Chrome and Edge
- I tested for responsiveness on all standard screen sizes using devtools.
- All text is readable and easy to understand
- The form functions correctly, requires input on all field and the email field requires an email address. The submit button also works.

## Bugs

This has not been deployed to GitHub Pages yet but I will test it more when I do have it deployed.
I believe I have used absolute file paths so that may present a problem.

## Validator Testing

- HTML:
    - error about the "initial-scale" attribute found in the meta element. This was part of the template, perhaps it needs updating.
    - error on Gallery and SignUp pages about not using any divs.

- CSS:
    - No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

- Accessibility:
    - The colours and fonts are easy to read and have passed the lighthouse devtools test
