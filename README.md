## Testing
---
- Tested on browsers: Chrome and Edge
- I tested for responsiveness on all standard screen sizes using devtools.
- All text is readable and easy to understand
- The form functions correctly, requires input on all fields and the email field requires an email address. The submit button also works.

## Bugs

This has not been deployed to GitHub Pages yet but I will test it more when I do have it deployed.
I believe I have used absolute file paths so that may present a problem.

## Validator Testing

- HTML:
    - error about the "initial-scale" attribute found in the meta element. This was part of the template, perhaps it needs updating.
    - error on Gallery and SignUp pages about not using any divs.

- CSS:
    - No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

- Accessibility:
    - The colours and fonts are easy to read and have passed the lighthouse devtools test

## Credits
---
### Content
- Code was taken and inspired from the [Love Running](https://github.com/otherworldly94b/love-running) project for a lot of this current project.
- The biggest similarities should be in social media links, the "times" section and the Gallery page.
- The signup page should also have similarities but the code for it was written by me in the Love Running project as well.
- Some CSS code was also inspired from the [Love Running](https://github.com/otherworldly94b/love-running) project.
